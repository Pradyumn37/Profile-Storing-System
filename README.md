# Profile-Storing-System
Profile Storage System! This project is a full-stack application built to manage user profiles with a focus on secure image storage. It combines Spring Boot for the backend, Amazon S3 for storing profile pictures, React for a sleek frontend, and Spring Data JPA for database interactions. The system allows users to upload, store, and manage their profile details, with images securely saved in an AWS S3 bucket.
I’ve crafted this to explore real-world integrations like AWS services and RESTful APIs, while keeping the code clean and modular. The backend handles file uploads, user data persistence with JPA, and API endpoints, while the React frontend provides an intuitive interface for users. It’s a hands-on project I’ve been tinkering with to deepen my skills in cloud storage, reactive UI development, and database management.
